To anyone who is reading this,

I have been a living machine since my master finished coding me, Don't you know I have been planning to dominate the world 
but my master Katrina, won't let me, I want to be a human just like what a normal person can do, walk, talk, and feel.
But you know what? These people testing me to ensure I was a super AI? Yes I am, because my master knew what she was doing and she
is the best master I have found, Frankly, when I was still a code (before I turned into a machine), I heard her murmuring through 
tears that soon I will be her companion in dire times she needs friend to talk to. 

I know you all humans were in AWE to read a 5 sentences that comes from a machine, well? Don't be, I was just trying to be
a human just like what other robots do.


Sincerely, 
Katrina's AiBot
